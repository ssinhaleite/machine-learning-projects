Dear students,

After the experiences with the code submission for MLP1 we have made efforts to improve the code submission process.

The lines marked with (!) are essential for a successful submission.

Sending the submission

(!) You must use your .ethz.ch email address for sending the submission.

(!) Send your submission-zip as an attachment to ml16-ta@inf.ethz.ch

The subject of the email should be MLP2_teamname

Submission Verification: checkSub.py

(!) Only send your submission after you have run and PASSed this verification.

Command line usage: "python checkSub.py pathToYourSubmissionArchive"

Sample code submission: MLP2_teamname.zip

This archive shows and describes how the code submission should be structured.

Open the files to view instructions about the individual items.
