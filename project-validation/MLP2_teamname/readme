# Now comes the key section with the three subsections "Preprocessing",
# "Features" and "Model". Leave the headlines as they are and only
# modify the keys. Try to provide at least three informative keys per
# subsection and separate the keys with commas ",".

# Each key should be single word or concatenation of several words,
# e.g. crop, histogram, mutualinformationscore, linearregression, etc.
#
# The final section is "Description" which includes a verbose summary
# with no strict formatting but make sure it has a reasonable minimum
# length.

Description
Verbose and detailed description of preprocessing, features, model and
other things that are helpful to understand what was done exactly.
E.g. if key1 = histogram for features, then the description might look
like this: "We divide the image into 7x7x7 blocks and make a histogram
with 10 bins for each of them. These histograms are then concatenated
into a vector"
