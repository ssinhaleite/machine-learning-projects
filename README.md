Project 01
==========

Objective:
----------
- Predicting a person's age from brain MR images: in this project we apply regression techniques to predict a person's age from a three-dimensional magnetic resonance (MR) image of their brain.


About the code:
---------------

###General:
This code was created as an structure for the three projects in this course.
Contains:
- **imageAnalysis.py**: contains definition of MRI as a image. Used for plot the MRI and to compare two images
Example of usage:

```
image_Young = ia.ImageProperties(dataset[0]**1.)
image_Old = ia.ImageProperties(dataset[1]**1.)

image_Young.compare(image_Old)

``` 
- **MachineLearningAlgorithms.py**
- **scriptest.py**


###Dependencies:

###Configure:

###Usage:


Approaches:
-----------
1) Perform preprocessing W

2) Select k voxels according to X

3) Train model Y

4) Perform postprocessing Z
